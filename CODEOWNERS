# CODEOWNERS - Pattern examples:

# *.js @user # All .js files

# path/ @team # Directory and subdirectories

# path/file.ts @user # Specific file

# *\*/logs/ @team # Any logs directory

# docs/\* @user # Files in docs/ (not subdirs)

# Order matters - last match wins

# scripts/ @doctocat @octocat

# Go-to-market Team ownership

# NOTE: very broad match, putting it first so later more specific directives
# can overwrite parts of it
* @deepnote/platform
