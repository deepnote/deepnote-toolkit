Deepnote Toolkit is a set of tools to power [Deepnote data workspaces](https://deepnote.com/docs/workspaces).
It is responsible for starting and managing servers (Jupyter, Streamlit, LSP), as well as providing runtime integrations for a hassle-free experience when it comes to all your data needs.

## Features

- **Python kernel with scientific computing libraries preinstalled**, allowing you to focus on work instead of fighting with Python dependencies
- **First-class SQL authoring and execution** without overhead of database connectors and SDKs *(all supported integrations with data warehouses, databases, cloud storages, and many other tools are listed in [documentation](https://deepnote.com/docs/getting-started))*
- Native **Deepnote component library** including beautiful `DataFrame` rendering and interactive inputs
- **Visualize data with Vega**, along with additional support for Altair and Plotly
- Run multiple **interactive applications built with Streamlit**
- Language Server Protocol integration for code completion and intelligence
- Git integration with SSH/HTTPS authentication

## Installation

Although Deepnote Toolkit can be run as a Python package via the CLI, we highly recommend trying Deepnote via the VS Code extension or registering for the SaaS version at [deepnote.com](https://deepnote.com).

To start Deepnote Toolkit locally, first install it via `pip` or your favorite package manager:
```sh
pip install deepnote-toolkit
```

To use server components (Jupyter, Streamlit, LSP), add `server` extras bundle:

```sh
pip install deepnote-toolkit[server]
```


## CLI quickstart

To run Toolkit locally after installation use:

```bash
# show all available commands
deepnote-toolkit --help

# start Jupyter server on default port (8888)
deepnote-toolkit server

# start with custom configuration
deepnote-toolkit server --jupyter-port 9000

# view and modify configuration
deepnote-toolkit config show
deepnote-toolkit config set server.jupyter_port 9000
```

**Security Note**: The CLI will warn if Jupyter runs without authentication. For local development only. Set `DEEPNOTE_JUPYTER_TOKEN` for shared environments.
